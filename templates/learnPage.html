    <title>Password Strength Checker</title>

    <h2>What Makes a Strong Password?</h2>
    <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png">
    <p>
        Great question! A strong password is defined by one key characteristic: randomness! Then, why do all the
        websites outline the following requirements for a password: 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 special
        character, 1 number, and a minimum length of 8 characters. Many believe that this makes for a stronger password
        because it’s more “complex” and is hard for a human to guess – but, this complexity actually makes it easier for
        a computer or a program to crack your password.
    </p>

    <p>
        In fact, it is impossible for the human brain to choose a password that is truly random. When we try to identify
        a password that is both “complex” and easy for us to remember, we often end up following a prescribed pattern
        that is very easy for the computer to guess. As the XKCD comic suggests, a password such as <u>“correct horse
            battery staple”</u> chosen at random is stronger than a password that follows all the so-called password
        requirements to a T. To the human mind, “Tr0ub4dor&3” will look like the stronger password. However, it is
        actually extremely easy for a computer to guess. This apparent contradiction can be further understood through
        the concept of entropy.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Entropy?</h2>

    <p>
        Entropy is a measure of the randomness of a password (i.e., how many different possibilities an attacker must
        consider to crack your password). Length is one of the primary factors defining entropy; with more length,
        there’s more room for randomness. Entropy can also be increased by adding more characters to the mix – i.e.,
        lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. But, not the way a common sign up form suggests – to
        be truly strong, the password must be <u>>AS RANDOM AS POSSIBLE</u>. The more we try to build a
        structure/pattern/uniformness to the random password generation, the weaker our password becomes in the face of
        password crackers and other tools. That said, a truly random password such as “5&2CcKMvD8vy” is not something
        that the average internet user can remember, recollect, and use. As a result, we are left with two seemingly
        contrasting ideas: guessability and memorability.
    </p>

    <h2>Balancing Guessability & Memorability</h2>

    <p>
        The average American internet user is projected to have 300 accounts protected by passwords by 2022 – an
        impossible number of passwords to remember and recollect. As such, we recommend that you focus on remembering
        three to four passwords that are absolutely critical (i.e., Apple ID, Gmail, and laptop password) and use a
        secure, trusted password manager to aid with the rest.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, let’s talk about how to create strong and memorable passwords for those three to four critical accounts
        that you will have to memorize. The best password is one that is hard for an attacker to crack but easy for a
        user to remember. Passwords that we remember and recollect easily end up connected to us in some way; for
        instance, your mother’s maiden name may be quite obscure, but it may also be one of the first things any decent
        hacker may try. The strength of a password lies in its randomness, but even the strongest password can fail if
        you (1) cannot remember and recollect it as necessary or (2) rely on poor password usage strategies. This
        includes everything from writing it down on a sticky note, reusing the same strong password in multiple places,
        and saving passwords in unsecure locations. Theoretically, a password “5&2CcKMvD8vy” is strong, and a password
        “2y5!*iq8e!g#jlgR2enywnj14GOak6@*” is stronger, but neither is intuitive or memorable. So, how can we create a
        password that is both strong and memorable?
    </p>

    <p>
        Our answer is <a href="https://std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware</a>. Diceware is a strategy to choose
        passwords based on dice rolls. The
        strength of this
        strategy relies on the true randomness generated through several independent dice rolls. Under this strategy,
        you must roll an ordinary dice five times and use the resulting sequence of values to choose a word from the
        Diceware list. The original Diceware list is comprised of 7776 short words, easy to remember abbreviations, and
        special characters. Here’s a short excerpt of a Diceware list:
    </p>

    <table class="t1">
        <tr>
            <td>16655</td>
            <td>clause</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>16656</td>
            <td>claw</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>16661</td>
            <td>clay</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>16662</td>
            <td>clean</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>16663</td>
            <td>clear</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        The strategy recommends a password with a minimum length of 16 to 32 characters (approximately, 4-5 words as
        each word in the list is an average of 4.2 letters long). As such, a user may re-roll their dice 5 times to
        select an additional three to four words to add to their password. The resulting password may resemble the
        following: correct horse battery staple. While these are common dictionary words, when generated randomly, the
        resulting entropy is 164.7, which makes up quite the strong password. More importantly, in contrast to a
        password like “2y5!*iq8e!g#jlgR2enywnj14GOak6@*”, “correct horse battery staple” is much more memorable. You
        will have to put some time into memorizing it, but once memorized this will serve you much better than your
        mother’s maiden name, “complex” password like @ppl3s!$!, and is definitely more memorable than “5&2CcKMvD8vy” in
        the future.

    <h2>How Can Our Site Help You?</h2>

    <p>
        This website offers three unique tools:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Password Checker:</strong> This tool will help you check whether you are creating a password that
            uses a large pool
            of characters (i.e., a large character set), an appropriate password length, and avoiding common dictionary
            words.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Password Generator:</strong> This tool will help you generate a password that meets the standards we
            discussed in our
            earlier sections: a password that is easy to memorize and difficult to crack. Our generator relies on a
            Diceware-based strategy, but also increases the character set to include uppercase letters, digits, and 33
            standard keyboard symbols. The generator also shows a break-down of the words, capitalization, and
            symbol-inserts so that a user may easily commit it to memory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Password Entropy Calculator:</strong> This tool will help you check the entropy (i.e., the unit of
            randomness) in
            your password. Higher entropy values are associated with stronger passwords. A password with an entropy of
            25 to 35 bits is considered average; 70 to 85 bits is considered good with approximately 100 bits considered
            strong. We recommend aiming for a password with at least 100 bits of entropy. Keep in mind that our entropy
            calculator assumes that you generated your password randomly. If you did not generate your password
            randomly, our calculator is likely to exaggerate the strength of your password.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Does Our Password Checker Work?</h2>

    <p>
        Our password checker operates by checking to see if an entered password satisfies the following requirements:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The password is at least 12 characters long
        </li>
        <li>
            The password contains at least one capital letter, symbol, and number
        </li>
        <li>
            The password contains a sufficient number of unique characters
        </li>
        <li>
            The password does not contain a common dictionary word
        </li>
        <li>
            The password does not contain a reversed common dictionary word
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This allows us to follow the requirements of most modern websites and also protect passwords against dictionary
        attacks. A dictionary attack is when an attacker conducts a brute force run through common words and phrases to
        decode a password. Passwords must be invulnerable to dictionary attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
        After each check is completed, our strength checker will return all vulnerabilities in the password to the
        screen.
    </p>

    <h2>How Does Our Password Generator Work?</h2>

    <p>
        Through our password generator, you can generate a password that is either 14 to 20 characters, 20 to 28
        characters, or 28 to 32 characters long. Our password generator is based on <a
            href="https://std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware</a>, a strategy to choose
        passwords through several dice rolls. We use python’s in-built random() function to simulate 4 six-sided dice
        rolls and match the corresponding values to the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) <a
            href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/09/08/eff_short_wordlist_1.txt">wordlist</a>. This wordlist
        is a modified version of the original Diceware list; it is made up of shorter words and excludes special
        characters and easy-to-remember abbreviations. We adopted the modified wordlist from the EFF because the
        original Diceware list included special characters and abbreviations that added unnecessary complexity to our
        password generation strategy. Each word randomly chosen from this wordlist yields an additional 10.3 bits of
        entropy. Selecting four to five words from this list based on the user’s chosen length serves as the base for
        our password generation strategy. Given that most modern websites require the inclusion of numbers, symbols, and
        also capital letters in passwords, we inserted all of the mentioned into each word at the same random index.
        While the original Diceware strategy discusses a different way for adding special characters or numbers, we
        decided on this way because it allows for more memorable passwords while still retaining some degree of
        randomness.
    </p>

    <p>
        Upon selecting a length and clicking generate, a user will see the following populate their screen: a generated
        password, the original randomized word list, the position of the inserted symbol, and the position of the
        capitalized letters. This is all provided back to the user to ensure that the user (1) understands how the
        password was generated and (2) can better remember and recollect their password.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example:
    </p>

    <p>
        If the user selects the option of “28-32 characters (Recommended)” and clicks the button to generate a password,
        the system will provide the following information:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggested Password:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Wa.ter65Po.lo66Ta.lon67Bl.ank68
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Sequence of Words to Remember:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        water
    </p>
    <p>
        polo
    </p>
    <p>
        talon
    </p>
    <p>
        blank
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Position of Capitalized Letter:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>1</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Position of Symbol:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>3</p>

    <p>
        The system generated four random words using the Diceware technique. Each word concatenated would look like:
        “waterpolotalonblank”. Randomly generated numbers are inserted in an increasing order at the end of each word as
        such: “water65polo66talon67blank68”. The position of the capitalized letter (1) and symbol (3) are also randomly
        generated. Using the first letter of every word as the capital provides: “Water65Polo66Talon67Blank68”. The
        randomly generated symbol is inserted at the third position of each word: “Wa.ter65Po.lo66Ta.lon67Bl.ank68”.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the final generated password. This feature provides the sequence of words to remember, the position of
        the capitals, and the position of the symbols as a method to make remembering this strong password easier for
        our users.
    </p>

    <h2>How Does Our Password Entropy Calculator Work</h2>

    <p>Through our password entropy calculator, you can check the entropy of your password. Entropy is a measure of the
        randomness of a password (i.e., how many different possibilities an attacker must consider to crack your
        password). Our entropy calculator calculates entropy through the following formula: Entropy (E) = L x
        log<sub>2</sub>(R).
    </p>

    <p>
        L represents the length of the password, and R represents the size of the pool of characters. Entropy-wise, you
        can make your password stronger by either (1) increasing the length or (2) expanding the character set (i.e.,
        adding uppercase letters, digits, symbols). However, a longer password with only lowercase characters can be far
        stronger than a short and complex password; this is also obvious from the mathematical formula.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our entropy calculator allows users to enter a password, and outputs the resulting entropy value. To make sense
        of your value, please know how your password’s entropy compares in the following chart:
    </p>

    <table class="t2">
        <tr>
            <th class="th2">Entropy (in bits)</th>
            <th class="th2">Strength</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="td2">25-30 bits</td>
            <td class="td2">weak</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="td2">60-80 bits</td>
            <td class="td2">average</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="td2">~100 bits</td>
            <td class="td2">strong</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="td2">>100 bits</td>
            <td class="td2">very strong (recommended)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        We recommend that you prioritize length to increase the strength of your password; it is much more effective
        than increasing your character set by 10. That said, it is important to note that a high entropy value alone
        does not guarantee a strong password. We provide an entropy calculator to help you evaluate the strength of the
        password you randomly generated using your own Diceware or our password generator. Entropy is a measure of
        randomness, and our entropy calculator assumes that your password <u>was generated randomly</u>. If you use a
        password
        that is relevant to you personally, reuse a password, or use a leaked password, your password’s actual entropy
        value is likely much, much lower. Please be cautious as you use our entropy calculator to help you generate
        strong, secure passwords.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>DO NOT:</strong> reuse passwords or use passwords that are tied to you personally regardless of how
            obscure they are.
        </li>
        <li><strong>DO:</strong> use password managers to store the majority of your day-to-day passwords, and memorize
            the few crucial
            ones that you will need (Gmail, Apple ID, laptop password).</li>
        <li><strong>DO NOT:</strong> use common dictionary words as password unless they were generated randomly.</li>
        <li><strong>DO:</strong> generate your password randomly; randomness is key to a strong password. Diceware is
            one of the most
            prominent strategies to truly random passwords that are also memorable. Feel free to try our generator that
            uses the same strategy!
        </li>
        <li><strong>DO NOT:</strong> rely primarily on our entropy checker to verify your password’s strength; please
            know that the true
            measure of strength lies with randomness.
        </li>
        <li><strong>DO:</strong> increase the size of your password to increase their strength; once again, be mindful
            that this strategy
            only works if you avoid common dictionary words and use random password generation. </li>
    </ol>
